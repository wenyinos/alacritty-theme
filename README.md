# Alacritty Theme

Collection of colorschemes for easy configuration of the [Alacritty terminal
emulator].

## Installation

### Imports

Clone the repository, or download the theme of your choice:

```sh
# We use Alacritty's default Linux config directory as our storage location here.
mkdir -p ~/.config/alacritty/themes
git clone https://github.com/wenyinos/alacritty-theme ~/.config/alacritty/themes
cp ~/.config/alacritty/themes/alacritty.toml ~/.config/alacritty/
```

Add an import to your `alacritty.toml` (Replace `{theme}` with your desired
colorscheme):

```toml
[general]
import = [
    "~/.config/alacritty/themes/themes/{theme}.toml"
]
```

### Manual

To manually include a colorscheme in an existing `alacritty.toml`, you just need
to copy the entire content of the theme into the root level of your
configuration file.
